                <h2>Abdulakh Kurbanov</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm 29 y/o game-programmer student at Forsberg's School.</p>
				<p>I have been into sales and service past 10 years but after deep and long consideration I decided to change career path
				and game programming was a good place to start since gaming, sci-fi and fantasy stories are my hobby so I thought what's better than learning more about something you enjoy and make a living of it.</p>
				<p>I'm not entirely sure yet but I think my favorite things are Transformations and Shaders probably because Math is not my strongest suit and these areas offers most challenge and growth opportunity for me.</p>
				<p>Since joining Forsberg I've learned to work in object oriented manner, creating custom classes, functions and optimization patterns, I also learned little about different algorithms and their use cases.</p>
				<p>Probably most important thing I gained was general understanding of how teams work together to create something great, and that perfection is in the details.</p>
				<p>When it comes to coding, I just follow the curious impulse led by 'What if and How' questions(not very efficent, time-wise but so far so good) and I often find myself hardstuck with bugs. 
				So I think bug-tracing and hunting should be a class of it's own in games.</p>
				<p>Personality & Social behaviors: </p>
				<p>I'm usually calm and quiet person but can be light-hearted and playful sometimes.</p>
