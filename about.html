                <h2>Abdulakh Kurbanov</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm 29 y/o game-programmer student at Forsberg's School.</p>
				<p>I have been into sales and service past 10 years but I decided to change career path and game programming was a good place to start since gaming, 
				sci-fi and fantasy stories are my hobby so I thought what's better than learning more about something you enjoy and make a living of it.</p>
				<p>Recently I've discovered that my favorite thing is gameplay mechanics, to make abilities and combat systems, and the thing I'm least excited 
				about is SFX but I do think VFX is cool.</p>
				<p>Since joining Forsberg I've learned to work in object oriented manner, creating custom classes, functions and optimization patterns, I also learned about different algorithms and their use cases.</p>
				<p>Probably most important thing I gained was general understanding of how teams work together to create something great, and polishing a game is all about digging deep into the details.</p>
				<p>The funny thing is, I used to question what's possible when it comes to coding and creating but now I think anything is possible I just have to learn how to do it. </p>
				<p>As a complete beginner I started with Unity & C# but even tho Unity has it's charm I like Unreal Engine more. </p>
				<p>My aim for near future is to get better with UE5, C++ and learn Blender. </p>
