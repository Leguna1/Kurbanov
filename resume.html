                <h2>Event Salesperson at Viasat AB, Stockholm 2014 – 2014</h2>
				<p> My first job, directly after graduation, was at Viasat Field Sales. 
				I had no previous experience in sales and was unsure if this would suit me. 
				However, I saw it as an adventure and an opportunity to visit various events and talk to people about TV channels.</p>
				
				<h2>Field Salesperson at Viafield AB, Stockholm 2014 – 2016</h2>
				<p>Towards the end of 2014, I was recruited to Viafield by a friend who also worked in sales. 
				I went from event sales to home sales, where I sold comprehensive solutions for home telephony, broadband, and TV subscriptions. 
				It was an enjoyable and fun experience to travel around, visit different cities, and meet people in their homes.
				During this period of my life, I began to see myself as a seasoned and skilled salesperson thanks to my colleagues and all the opportunities I had been given along the way.</p>
				
				<h2>Customer Service Agent at Transcom WorldWide AB, Örebro 2016 – 2017</h2>
				<p>For two years, I practically saw the whole of Sweden, from south to north, and I felt a strong drive to continue to develop and learn more. 
				Towards the end of 2017, I had the opportunity to work as a customer service agent in Riga, where I helped Netflix customers with subscription questions and technical problems over the phone.</p>
				
				<h2>Field Salesperson at Viasat AB, Stockholm 2017 – 2017</h2>
				<p>A few months after my time in Riga, I returned to Sweden and got the opportunity to work for a startup company as a reseller for Comhem, Canal Digital, and Boxer. 
				Shortly thereafter, I heard that Viasat was looking for new salespeople. 
				My sentimental nature drove me back there, and after an interview that involved a gold pen, I started working as an event and field salesperson for Viasat Field Sales.</p>
				
				<h2>Recruiter at the Red Cross, Örebro 2018 – 2018</h2>
				<p>After having fulfilled my purpose with Viasat and completing the circle, I returned to my hometown and started working as a membership recruiter for the Red Cross. 
				My time there lasted about four months, and even though it felt good to work with charity, I felt a strong desire to learn something new.</p>
				
				<h2>Telemarketer at Aldovo AB, Örebro 2018 – 2019</h2>
				<p>It took a few attempts with different companies in electricity subscriptions before I realized that I really wanted to develop in telephone sales. 
				By chance, I met an old classmate in town who gave me the chance to work at Aldovo. 
				There I had the opportunity to develop my ability to use my voice as a powerful tool, and for about a year, I sold dental cards over the phone.</p>
				
				<h2>Field Salesperson at Innovative Sales AB, Stockholm 2019 – 2020</h2>
				<p>A colleague and former employer had started a new company, and I was completely sold on the campaign and the high-quality products and services offered there. 
				I returned to field sales and delivered everything from Telenor's home telephony, broadband, TV channels, mobile phones to tablets with good quality. 
				It was a fantastic experience, and I enjoyed it very much until it became more difficult to have direct contact with customers due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
				
				<h2>Customer Service Agent at Transcom AB, Örebro 2021 – 2023</h2>
				<p>Recrutive played a crucial role in helping me get a trial position at Transcom. 
				There I worked as a customer service agent, welcoming Tele2 customers and solving their subscription questions, invoices, and technical problems over the phone. 
				Thanks to my colleagues and coach, I later got a permanent position and also had the opportunity to work as a chat agent with written communication towards set goals.</p>
