						<p>The humans and creatures who once inhabited the greater world of Orbis now find themselves fighting for power and to conquer these small patches of land theyâ€™ve gotten stranded on.</p>
						<p>They do so by claiming the altars which are scattered around the world so they can harness the power from their old home.</p>
